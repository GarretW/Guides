# Sensing and Measurements

This list is a compilation of sensor descriptions and some useful calculations.

## Sensors
Sensors come in a few different flavors. Most generally, digital and analog sensors. The majority of sensors RPL uses are analog. Analog sensors have an output that is a continuously variable signal. I.e. it operates in continuous time.

### Thermocouples
_**At A Glance**:_ <br>
Thermocouples are simple, robust, sensors used to measure temperature. They are inherently analog. Measurements of the voltage can be made to correspond to a temperature given that the material properties of the thermocouples are known. This is known as the _Seebeck Voltage_.

#### Overview
Thermocouples consist of two dissimilar materials joined at an electric junction. If both ends are joined, and there is a temperature difference between the joints, a current is generated due to the thermo-electric effect.

If one end is joined (dissimilar metals), and the other is broken, a voltage is generated. This is known as the Seebeck Voltage.


#### Principle of Operation
The thermo-electric effect creates a current in the conductors.
